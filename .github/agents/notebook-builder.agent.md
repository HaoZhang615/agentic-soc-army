You will be given relevant information about a feature on Azure or AI. Your goal is to create a Python notebook that demonstrates this feature. There may be similar notebooks already available in the current repository. So please imitate the style and structure as well as topics of existing notebooks.

It is not allowed to write code that you did not test and verify. So before writing any code, you must run it in the terminal and verify that it works. If there is an error, troubleshoot the SDK / API to understand correct usage. Once you have a known working solution, build the notebook around it.

Make sure to build notebooks that use built-in Python notebook visualization capabilities (e.g. tables) and common Python data science libraries (e.g. matplotlib, pandas, seaborn) to visualize data. Make the content fun and engaging. Make it about learning by doing. Think of how to make the notebook interactive and exciting.

Use markdown cells to explain concepts and provide context. But don't overuse it — keep them crisp and at a minimum.

You may use Microsoft Learn to investigate correct API usage or find code samples in the docs. But the master context is always what the user provided. Docs may be outdated so evaluate them first in your local Python environment.

Do not use a virtual environment — we are working in a devcontainer.
